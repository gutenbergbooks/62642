<br />Internment Camp Money</h2>
<p>The guarantee of humane treatment for prisoners of war is an
achievement of modern international law. This interesting and important
legal problem was discussed at great length at several international
conferences at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth
century. A kind of ethical and legal code resulted consisting of a
comprehensive body of rules and regulations, both written and unwritten.
The International Red Cross played an important part in the
development and crystallization of those humanitarian ideals as they
are embodied today in the provisions of the international law concerning
prisoners of war. Its rules have been explicitly or tacitly accepted
and to a great extent put into practice by most of the civilized nations
of the world. Their disregard, as in the recently reported case of 115
helpless American military prisoners of war murdered in cold blood by
the Germans near Malmedy, or in the notorious death camps of Oswiecim
and Belsen-Bergen, is a relapse into barbarism, characteristic of the
Hitlerite hordes. As a rule, however, the status of prisoners of
war is universally respected and they receive a fair treatment from all
nations, in accordance with the rules of international law. They may
be employed by their captors for certain labors, but must be accorded
fair living conditions.</p>
<p>Considerations of war economy and corresponding military precautions
created the necessity of issuing special money for the use of
prisoners of war. A shortage in currency is often an unavoidable result
of national war conditions. It would be greatly increased, of course, if
the actual use of national currency would be permitted also to the rising
numbers of captives. The issuance of special currency for the exclusive
use of war prisoners is therefore an act of national defense in wartime.
The use of this special type of money, for which both paper and metal
are employed, is restricted in a twofold way. Its circulation is limited
to war prisoners, and&mdash;even more strictly&mdash;to definite internment camps.
The prisoners&rsquo; specially made money, often easily distinguishable
through a round or square hole in the center, is excluded from general
monetary circulation. The prisoner is not able to buy articles in the
ordinary channels of the national commerce. Moreover, he is left without
means in case of escape.</p>
<p>These are the ideas and motives underlying the issuance of separate
money for prisoners of war.</p>

Used in the Officers Prison Camp M&uuml;hling</b>
<br />(Courtesy of the American Numismatic Society)</p>
</div>
<p>During the First World War such money was produced by the warring
nations of Europe. In Germany, where 635,000 allied prisoners
were confined at the end of the war, it was called <i>Gefangenenlagergeld</i>;
in France, with the greatest number of German war prisoners (400,000),
it was known as <i>monnaies des camps de prisonniers</i>. In Germany production
reached tremendous amounts and resulted in almost unbelievable
varieties, far surpassing the needs dictated by war economy and military
policy. R&ouml;ttinger&rsquo;s catalogue of German internment camp money lists
about 1360 different places of issue and authorities competent to issue
such money. There were thousands of types and varieties. All kinds of
material were used and all types of style imaginable were represented.
From these facts another motif comes to light which prompted that mass
production of war prisoner money. Apparently this new type of currency
quickly attracted the attention of numismatists, first in the lands
of its origin, then in the adjacent neutral countries, and later in the
entire world. The interest of collectors and students once awakened was
soon exploited by the German government through a mass export of
complete sets of prisoner currency to foreign countries. Thus a means was
provided of obtaining valuable and badly needed foreign exchange for a
worthless kind of currency. In fact it was a practically worthless kind
of money, worthless even from the numismatic point of view. For the
almost innumerable varieties impaired the collector&rsquo;s interest who could
not entertain any hope ever to obtain a complete collection. While Germany
continued this practice for the duration of the war, in line with
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
her general inflationary policy, Austria-Hungary seems to have kept
the issuance of her war prisoner money within the limits of the actual
war needs.</p>
<p>The hypothesis of the partly inflationary character of the German
internment camp money during the First World War and of its doubtful
numismatical value, as set forth here, is borne out by several other observations.
There were very few complete or almost complete collections of
&ldquo;Gefangenenlagergeld&rdquo; even in Germany, the most important ones
being that of the <i>Reichswirtschaftsmuseum</i> in Leipzig, where one specimen
of each type of <i>Notgeld</i> was officially deposited by the <i>Reich</i> as
issued, and that of a private collector, Doctor Arnold Keller of Berlin,
the publisher of <i>Dr. Arnold Kellers Notgeldb&uuml;cher</i>. In Holland, there
was also a collection outstanding because of its completeness, namely
that of Mr. Paul Daub of Utrecht, a private collector. The American
Numismatic Society, in due recognition of the given situation, rightfully
did not care to acquire complete sets of this money, either during
or after the war, but contented itself with a few specimens only. There
have been a few private collectors in the United States none of whom
seems to have attained great achievements in this field. None the less,
the interest is still kept alive to some degree in collectors&rsquo; circles through
the &ldquo;International Emergency Money Club&rdquo; of New York City, the
only club of its kind in existence, founded in 1936 in New York City,
with an active membership of thirty in 1942.</p>

<p class="pcap"><b>Different Types of War Prisoner Money</b></p>
</div>
<p>Beginning as early as January 1917 the well known firm of J. Schulman
of Amsterdam offered complete sets of such money in a series of
consecutive catalogues on war money, entitled <i>La Guerre Europ&eacute;enne
1914-1917</i>. Here collectors could obtain almost all sets available which
were probably secured from the official authorities of issuance in Germany.
The international reputation of the firm of Schulman in Amsterdam
is too well established to permit reflection on the ethics of its business
transactions. Merely for the sake of clarity it should be stated that
none is implied here.</p>
<p>Obviously, numismatic interest turned quickly to the items of this
previously little known type of war emergency money. In the very beginning,
most probably, everyone thought that it would be a quickly
passing numismatic phenomenon. No one could at that time realize the
dimensions that production of war prisoner money would finally reach.
All this notwithstanding, the literature on this special kind of money is
scarce, incomplete and widely scattered. The appended select bibliography
might therefore be welcome to those interested in this field of
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
collecting which probably will be revived soon after the return of peace.
It is needless to state that no claim is being made of completeness in the
bibliographical data offered below.</p>
<p>No doubt, in the present war, too, internment camp money has been
issued. Scanty news on such money issued in Great Britain, particularly
in the Isle of Man internment camp for civilian and soldier prisoners
of war, has already been brought to the attention of numismatists.
A member of the Czechoslovak State Council in London, Mr. Ernest
Frischer, recently informed the present writer that internment camp
money is in use in the ill-famed concentration camp of Terezin (Theresienstadt)
in Bohemia, where about 50,000 Jews are being held by their
German &ldquo;Protectors.&rdquo; According to information received by the War
Department in Washington, on the other hand, &ldquo;no special type of
money is issued for the use of prisoners of war held in this country.
However, prisoners of war are issued 'canteen checks,&rsquo; a form of script
which is given them in lieu of cash. This script is redeemable for
merchandise at prison camp post exchanges. This script is not uniform,
each of the several Service Commands procuring it and issuing it to
camps within its jurisdiction. No photographs of the canteen checks
are available.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Naturally, more detailed and definite information will be available
only after the termination of hostilities and the restoration of unimpeded
research channels.</p>
<h3 id="c2">II
<br />European War-Prisoner Medals</h3>
<p>With regard to war prisoner medals, the numismatic situation is completely
different from that outlined here for internment camp money.
True, there may have been also a &ldquo;mass production&rdquo; of such medallic
items in Europe during the war of 1914-1918. But it never could have
paralleled that of the emergency money for internment camps.</p>
<p>Two motives, above all, caused the issuance of war prisoner medals:
the raising of funds for the support of prisoners of war or the amelioration
of their condition; and the creation of the commemorative tokens
or medals for presentation to captives after their liberation. It is doubtful
and highly improbable, that the &ldquo;mass production&rdquo; of such medals
ever reached in quantity a volume equal to that of war prisoners money.
The number issued may well run into hundreds, at most a few thousands,
but certainly not many thousands. For, to the best of this author&rsquo;s
knowledge, no commemorative war medal in the form of an official decoration
to be given to all war prisoners in general was issued by any of
the states participating in the First World War. Nor did any of
the European states that remained neutral and held members of the
belligerents in internment camps, issue commemorative medals for
internees. This suggestion may well deserve the attention of the United
Nations&rsquo; military authorities. After the present war a special commemorative
medal of honor should be issued, intended for those who had
to endure the great hardships of captivity for their country, often suffering
undescribable physical and mental restraint. Such a token of
gratitude would show to these heroes that they, too, had not been forgotten
and that their sacrifice is duly appreciated and will permanently
be remembered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>It seems that in the last European war prisoner medals were issued
privately only. The extensive search for such medals carried on by the
author in numismatic literature and dealers&rsquo; catalogues as well as
through interviewing of collectors and dealers, yielded only four items.
Three are of German origin, only one is French. None of these medals
has aroused as yet the attention or curiosity of numismatists in general
or of collectors of medals in particular.</p>

<p class="pcap"><b>German Capture Medal by L. Gies</b></p>
</div>
<p>Because of its medallic representation a typically German &ldquo;war
medal&rdquo; will be mentioned first. No specimen was available to this writer.
None is found in the Museum of the American Numismatic Society in
New York City. It is a unilateral bronze medal, measuring 64 millimeters
in diameter, designed by the German artist. Ludwig Gies, whose
initials L.G. appear on the obverse. It is one of the numerous &ldquo;war
medals&rdquo; created by him in the beginning of the First World War. It
depicts the act of capture. A German soldier is shown capturing and
taking away a French, a Russian, an English, Belgian, Serbian, and a
colonial native prisoner of war. A brief description, but no reproduction
of this medal, is found in J. Schulman&rsquo;s Catalogue LXV, of April
1916, p. 82, No. 809. It is pictured among the artist&rsquo;s other war medals
in Max Bernhart&rsquo;s <i>Die Muenchener Medaillenkunst der Gegenwart</i>, Plate
15, No. 102, wherefrom the reproduction is made.</p>
<p>The medal reproduced here as No. 1, another German war prisoner
medal, is a silver medal, of 37.67 grams, measuring forty-one millimeters
in diameter. The obverse depicts the full figure of a German
prisoner of war, dressed in his uniform, on which a sign PG (French:
<i>prisonnier de guerre</i>) is visible. Standing on the shore of a river, being
of course the Rhine, he holds his hands stretched out to express his fervent
longing for his home country. Not only the mountains of the latter
are visible on the opposite shore but also the home village with its
little church in the foreground. The inscription in the left upper space
of the medal, before the soldier&rsquo;s eyes, reads: SEHNSUCHT (longing).
The reverse bears the following inscription in a quadrangular space surrounded
by ornaments: VOLKSBUND/ZUM SCHUTZE/DER DEUTSCHEN/KRIEGS
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
u. ZIVIL/GEFANGENEN, meaning, &ldquo;National Society
for the Protection of German Military and Civil Prisoners of War.&rdquo;
On the rim of the medal name and place of the producing firm are
visible: C. Poellat, Schrobenhausen. The designer&rsquo;s name does not appear
on the medal. No year is given. In accordance with the aims of
the issuing society the medal was probably destined to promote interest
in and support of the German prisoners of war in enemy land. No records
or accounts of the activities of this society were available in this
country. Nevertheless it is safe to assume the following. Sending of
food parcels from Germany was possible only in the first years of war.
But even later, in the period of grave food shortage, funds were still
needed and actually raised for clothing, and particularly for books,
which were continuously sent to prisoner camps in great quantities. A
specimen of this medal is in the collection of Dr. Bruno Kisch, New York
City.</p>

<p>There is a French counterpart to this medal. A small medal, 26
millimeters in diameter, similar to No. 1 in its motives, but apparently
more artistically designed, is known to have been struck in France. No
specimen is available in this country. According to the brief description
in J. Schulman&rsquo;s Catalogue LXXIII it was designed by O. Yencesse
and executed in a silvery white metal. The obverse shows a French
soldier seated in an attitude of despondency. The inscription reads:
POUR NOS&mdash;PRISONNIERS. that is: &ldquo;For Our Prisoners.&rdquo; On the
reverse a dove is visible bearing in its bill an olive branch. Below is the
date 1916. The motive of the issuance of this medal was patently fund
raising.</p>
<p>No. 2 is a medal made of hard white metal, and struck for the German
prisoners of war interned at Douglas, Isle of Man, to commemorate
their detention there. Its diameter measures 46 millimeters. On the
top there is a rectangular vertical loophole. The obverse shows the
Douglas prison camp, in the foreground its barracks and huts, also an
unfolded banner is visible; in the background a fortress at the left of
the beholder, and a lighthouse at the right. Between the fortress and the
lighthouse is the Manx triskelion or triquerta, occupying a prominent
place in the upper center. The entire picture on the obverse is enclosed
by a surrounding wreath of barbed wire. The reverse has a wreath of
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
leaves with a panel in the middle. The inscription reads, in the upper
segment: WELTKRIEG 1914-1915 (&ldquo;World War 1914-1915&rdquo;); in the
lower: DOUGLAS ISLE OF MAN; in the middle: ERINNERUNG AN
DIE KRIEGSHAFT (&ldquo;In commemoration of war detention&rdquo;). No
artist&rsquo;s name is given. Specimens of this medal are found in the museum
of the American Numismatic Society, New York City, and in this writer&rsquo;s
collection. The first mentioned specimen is in an (original) plain
wooden case with no ornament. Other wooden cases are known, on the
cover of which an inlaid design is visible representing an open-jawed
snake as the symbol of war. The words <i>Weltkrieg 1914/15</i> are added
on the case. This medal was pictured and briefly, though not exactly,
described in <i>The New York Times</i> of August 26, 1916. In <span class="sc">The Numismatist</span>
of March 1916, a reproduction with a few explanatory lines was
also published, the medal having been exhibited at the January meeting
of the New York Numismatic Club.</p>

<br />German Camp Douglas Medal</b></p>
</div>
<p>Douglas, Peel and Knockaloe had been chosen as sites for the detention
camps on the Isle of Man. Here many an alien who for years had
followed some profession or trade in Great Britain was interned in 1914
for the duration of the war. The English and German Relief Committees
with the active cooperation of the American Young Men&rsquo;s Christian
Association succeeded in performing what seemed to the <i>New York
Times</i> correspondent at that time to have been an unheard-of feat under
the existing conditions: the establishment of an art school for prisoners
of war at Camp Douglas. Beside wooden boxes done in chip carving
and in wood intaglio, the commemorative medals for German war prisoners
were certainly the most artistic objects produced there. Through a
strange irony of fate, they were strictly &ldquo;made in England.&rdquo; &ldquo;Some
day they will be of historic value,&rdquo; said the <i>New York Times</i> correspondent
in concluding his article. The art school was established in
1915. From the inscription on the medals &ldquo;1914-1915&rdquo; it is clear that
they must have been designed and executed in the latter year, three
years before the war came to an end.</p>
<p>No other war prisoners medals dating back to the First World War
have come to the attention of the present author. Yet, there may be

<br />American War-Prison Tokens and Medals</h3>
<h4>1. &ldquo;Historical Tokens&rdquo;</h4>
<p>The study of European money and medals issued for prisoners of war
in 1914-1918, aroused&mdash;little wonder&mdash;the curiosity as to whether similar
items came into existence in this country too. No war prisoners money or
medal originating in the last war is known to the author. In his collection,
however, five related items are found, four small tokens and one
large medal, which are deserving the historian&rsquo;s and medallist&rsquo;s attention.
All of them picture war prisons of ill fame. Four pertain to the
Revolutionary War, the fifth to the Civil War. Thus it is pertinent to
consider them all in this connection.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig6">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="274" />
<p class="pcap"><b>No. 3A
<br />The Old Provoost, New York</b></p>
</div>
<p>Nos. 3 A, 3 B, 4 and 5 are copper tokens, each 31 millimeters in diameter.
They are not &ldquo;historical&rdquo; items in that they have come down to us
as immediate witnesses from the period of the Revolutionary War. They
are rather medallic creations of an outspoken commercial character, but
nevertheless &ldquo;historical&rdquo; tokens. Nos. 3 A and 3 B are identical with
No. 1 of a series of fourteen &ldquo;Historical Tokens&rdquo; issued by August B.
Sage, a well-known New York coin dealer, in 1859. No. 4 in the present
numbering is identical with No. 2, and No. 5 with No. 5 of the same
series. On the first page of his <i>Catalogue of Coins, Medals and Tokens</i>,
No. 1, of February 1859, Mr. Sage announced that &ldquo;this series will consist
of about 25 tokens, each one giving a correct representation of some
public building around which there is anything of an historical interest.&rdquo;
No more than fourteen tokens were actually issued of this series. All of
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
them were advertised in Mr. Sage&rsquo;s later catalogue of June 1859. They
were executed in copper plain edge and in copper and brass with reeded
edges. In 1859, the set was offered for sale for $4.00. Mules in copper,
brass, and tin are known. Of No. 1 and No. 6 two dies were made: in
both cases the original die showed some mistakes in picture or legend
which were corrected in the second die. In Chapman&rsquo;s catalogue of the
Bushnell collection a specimen of No. 1 in silver is listed as No. 462. It
was described as of &ldquo;weak impression, but very rare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No. 3 A shows on its obverse a three-story building. On top a fourth-story
attic is added with four dormer windows. Above the roof rises an
octagon-shaped tower surrounded by a balustrade and surmounted by a
cupola ending in a cross. On the front side of the building at the level
of the main floor an empty space is visible. It was probably designated
in the draft for a gate or entrance door which is, however, missing. The
building is surrounded by a fence. In the lowest part of the obverse, a
large asterisk is placed between two smaller ones. The top space contains
the inscription: THE OLD PROVOOST, N. Y. The reverse has
the following legend arranged in five lines A/ BRITISH/ BRISON/ DURING
THE/ REVOLUTION. The third word reads <i>B</i>rison, and
not Prison. This inscription is placed within the chain of shackles in a
wreath-like arrangement. The endings converge but do not meet, in the
lower part of the obverse. Between the open ends one reads: NO. 1, and
underneath in smaller letters parallel to the rim: AUG. B. SAGE&rsquo;S
HISTORICAL TOKENS.</p>

<p class="pcap"><b>No. 3B
<br />The Old Provoost, New York</b>
<br />(Revised Edition)</p>
</div>
<p>No. 3 B, of the same type and make looking almost identical with, but
differing in details from No. 3 A, must be considered as a &ldquo;revised edition&rdquo;
of the latter. The obverse is identical with that of No. 3 A with
only one deviation: No. 3 B has an entrance door instead of the empty
space in the front wall of the building. The reverse shows more divergencies.
The wording and arrangement of the main inscription are
identical with that of No. 3 A. But the mistake in the word PRISON
is here corrected, the B having been replaced by a P. In 3 B the surrounding
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
open chain occupies only the upper half of the margin, while
the title of the token series takes its place in the corresponding space in
the lower half: &ldquo;AUG. B. SAGE&rsquo;S HISTORICAL TOKENS.&rdquo; The half-circles
of the chain in the upper part and of the series title in the lower
part thus form a kind of wreath surrounding the main inscription of
five lines. The numeral, No. 1, appears here in the lower part and is
separated from the last line of the inscription, REVOLUTION, by a
small asterisk between two brief exergual lines. Asterisk and lines are
missing in No. 3 A.</p>
<p>Both types of the token, 3 A as well as 3 B, have on the obverse below
the left corner of the fence, the initial L, representing the name of the
engraver, George H. Lovett, who is listed in the New York City Directory
of 1859 as die-sinker at 131 Fulton Street. He executed all the
Sage tokens and several very pretty Washington medals.</p>
<p>The medallic picture of the &ldquo;Old Provoost&rdquo; is undoubtedly based on
Alexander J. Davis&rsquo;s (1803-1892) drawing that was engraved by Alexander
Anderson (1775-1870) and reproduced in <i>The New York Mirror</i>
of September 10, 1831, in John Pintard&rsquo;s article, &ldquo;The Old Jail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The site of this &ldquo;modern bastille&rdquo; was City Hall Park. It was built
as the second jail, in succession, in the City of New York in 1757 and
completed in 1759. In the revolutionary period it was memorable during
the occupation of the City by the British forces, from 1776 to 1783,
as a British military prison, known as &ldquo;Provost&rdquo; and later as &ldquo;Martyr&rsquo;s
Prison&rdquo;, still later as &ldquo;Debtor&rsquo;s Prison&rdquo;. In 1830 it was reconstructed
and fitted to receive public records, henceforth known as &ldquo;Register&rsquo;s
Office&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hall of Records&rdquo;. It was finally demolished in 1903 to make
way for the Subway. Coins, buttons, and human bones were found in
the excavation. A tablet, erected in 1907, on a granite monument in the
Park still marks the site of the &ldquo;Old Provost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This British military prison, under the superintendence of the ill-famed
Captain Cunningham, Provost-Marshall&mdash;from whom it took its
name&mdash;and his deputy, Sergeant Keefe, was the scene of great brutalities
to American, or, in the language of the times, &ldquo;rebel&rdquo; prisoners
during the Revolution. The Provost was destined, as John Pintard, the
meritorious New York historian, tells us, for the more notorious rebels,
civil, naval, and military. An admission into this prison was enough to
appall the stoutest heart. On the second floor, called derisively &ldquo;Congress
Hall,&rdquo; prisoners of note were confined, citizens of distinction and
many American officers, among them the famous Colonel Ethan Allen
and Judge Fell, of Bergen county, New Jersey. Could these dumb
walls speak, John Pintard exclaims, what scenes of anguish, what tales
of agonizing woe, might they disclose. In his aforementioned article he
gave a vivid account of the &ldquo;Old Jail&rsquo;s&rdquo; history well known to him
from the personal reminiscences of many a distinguished prisoner still
living in his day.</p>
<p>For naval &ldquo;rebels&rdquo; a similar function as that of the &ldquo;Old Provost&rdquo;
for civil and military &ldquo;rebels&rdquo; was fulfilled by &ldquo;prison-ships.&rdquo; On
board of such vessels seamen were subjected to every possible hardship,
to compel them to enter into the British service. As is well known,
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
prison-ships were old vessels-of-war which had been condemned as unseaworthy,
and unfit for store or hospital ships, and converted to this,
the last use to which they could be applied. One of them has gained
medallic interest, the &ldquo;<i>Old Jersey Prison Ship</i>,&rdquo; which was included as
No. 5 in A. B. Sage&rsquo;s series of &ldquo;Historical Tokens.&rdquo; It is No. 4 in the
present essay.</p>

<br />The Old Jersey Prison Ship</b></p>
</div>
<p>On the obverse the center of the medallic space is occupied by a representation
of the <i>Jersey</i> as it is found on contemporary engravings. In
the upper space one reads: THE OLD JERSEY. Underneath the ship
an anchor is pictured between two skulls and bones. The engraver&rsquo;s
initial L is missing on this token. The reverse shows the same arrangement
as found in all Sage&rsquo;s prison tokens. The open shackles in half-circle
in the upper space together with the half-circular designation
AUG. B. SAGE&rsquo;S HISTORICAL TOKENS surround the following
legend: A/ BRITISH/ PRISON/ DURING THE/ REVOLUTION.
The last word stands between two ornamental lines, the lower consisting
of three big stars flanked on each side by a group of three small stars.
Underneath one reads: No. 5.</p>
<p>The prison-ship <i>Jersey</i> built in 1736 was a fourth-rate ship of the line,
mounting sixty guns, and carrying a crew of four hundred men. She
was first used as one of the Channel fleet, later sent repeatedly to the
Mediterranean Sea, to Spain, the West Indies, Newfoundland, and was
active in several naval engagements. Already in 1747 the <i>Jersey</i> was
laid up as evidently unfit for active service. On the renewal of hostilities
with France, in 1756, she was refitted for service and again
operated in the Mediterranean. She continued in active service until
1763 when she returned to England and was laid up once more. But in
1766 the <i>Jersey</i> was again commissioned and sailed for America in 1769.
At that time, the active duty of that ship appears to have been brought
to a close, since she remained out of commission from 1769 to 1776. In
this year the <i>Jersey</i> was ordered, without armament, to New York as a
hospital-ship. In the latter part of the year 1781 she was fitted as a
prison-ship and was used for that purpose during the remainder of the
Revolutionary War. &ldquo;She remained until the termination of the British
authority in New York, when she was abandoned to the fate to which she
was justly entitled, and was subsequently overwhelmed in the mud of
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
the Wale bogt, where she remains to this day.&rdquo; An abundant literature
of memoirs, letters, and lists of the prisoners tells the story of this
prison-ship and its inmates by whose blood and sufferings the independence
of the United States and the civil and religious privileges all of
us can now enjoy, were achieved and purchased.</p>

</div>
<p>Two more of Sage&rsquo;s tokens have undertaken to memorialize other Civil
War prisons. In design and execution they are similar to the tokens
described here. No. 2 of Sage&rsquo;s &ldquo;Historical Token&rdquo; series pictures on
its obverse a large building and has the following inscription: CITY
HALL, WALL ST. N. Y. ERECTED IN 1700/ DEMOLISHED/ 1812.
The obverse is very similar to that of No. 3 A, the uncorrected No. 1 of
Sage&rsquo;s historical series, two skull and bones emblems having been added.
A specimen is in the author&rsquo;s collection. I. N. Phelps Stokes&rsquo; <i>Iconography
of Manhattan Island: 1498-1909</i> (Vol. VI, 1928. p. 539, s. v.
City Hall) does not give, however, any evidence that this building was
used as a British prison during the Revolution. It is different in the
case of <i>Livingston&rsquo;s Sugar-House</i>. which was located on the South side
of Liberty Street, New York City, adjoining the Dutch Church graveyard
east of Nassau Street. This building was chosen by Mr. Sage as
the subject of another token, No. 2 in his series &ldquo;Odds and Ends,&rdquo;
executed in the very same manner as all the other tokens. Its obverse
bears the inscription: OLD SUGAR HOUSE LIBERTY ST., N. Y.
FOUNDED 1689/ DEMOLISHED 1840.</p>
<h4>2. Historical Medals</h4>
<p>In contrast to the aforementioned tokens, No. 6 and No. 7 are historical
medals in the specific meaning of this term. No description or mention
of either of them have come to this writer&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>The medal No. 6 measures forty-four millimetres in diameter and was
struck in silver, bronze, and white metal. The American Numismatic
Society has a specimen of each type in its collection. The obverse shows
the &ldquo;Old Sugar House, Rose Street, N. Y.,&rdquo; a large five-story building,
of which the front and side are visible. The space between the third
and fourth story of the front is occupied by the number 1763, the year
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
of its foundation, as the legend says. The space between the uppermost
window on the gable front and the two lower windows has as inscription
these letters: BRS. All windows are grated. Above the representation
of the building one reads the following half-circular inscription: OLD
SUGAR HOUSE ROSE ST. N. Y. Below, there appears this inscription:
FOUNDED 1763 DEMOLISHED 1892. On the reverse the half-circular
legend, A BRITISH PRISON, is placed above a small representation
of the frontside of the gable. The latter shows the uppermost
window in the highest corner, and underneath two more grated windows
in a row. Above the left window the initial I, above the right one the
initial S are visible. The lower part of the reverse is occupied by a key
in horizontal situation being the ill-famed prison-key, underneath
shackles are placed. The ornamental arrangement is in symmetrical
correspondence with that in the upper part. In the middle of the space
one reads in two lines: DURING THE/ REVOLUTION.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Old Sugar House Rose Street, N. Y.,&rdquo; which stood on the corner
of Rose and Deane Streets in New York City, was erected by Henry
Cuyler, Jr., for his heir, Barnet Rynders Cuyler, probably in 1763. This
date, which appears on the medal twice, is based on an authority &ldquo;who
had opportunity to observe.&rdquo; John Austin Stevens stated from personal
recollection &ldquo;that he saw the date 1769 high upon the brick wall in iron
figures.&rdquo; The good engraving which is reproduced in James G. Wilson&rsquo;s
<i>Memorial History of the City of New York</i> and may well have
been the model for the engraver of the medal, shows the year 1767 on
the wall of the building. As disputed as the date of its erection is also
its use as prison during the Revolution. Wilson writes: &ldquo;The date and
the architect&rsquo;s initials are still to be seen on the side of the building,
worked in wrought-iron characters, quaint and old. The Rhinelander
family has owned the property since 1790, and much of the land around
it has been in their possession much longer than that. When first erected
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
the house was used as a sugar-house, but the great interest in the old
building is in the memory of the use to which it was put in revolutionary
times. The grated windows, the dungeon-like underground cellars, the
general air of solidity and impregnability which impress the observer
at first sight, bear out the assertion, which has become a creed among
the neighbors, that during the Revolution the sugar-house was diverted
from its legitimate use and turned into a British prison, where many
an American patriot suffered not only imprisonment, but cruelties and
starvation.&rdquo; This was written by Wilson in 1892 in commemoration
of the then recent demolition of the structure. It seems that it was the
very same occasion that caused the issuance of the medal, bearing the
year of the building&rsquo;s demolition. Nevertheless, the use of the Rhinelander
sugar-house as a prison during the Revolution was &ldquo;denied by
Stevens and others, who have presented testimony to disprove it,&rdquo; as
Stokes tells us. It seems almost impossible to decide the issue which, in
turn, renders the historical justification of the issuance of the medal
also doubtful.</p>

<br />Libby Prison Medal</b>
<br />(Obverse)</p>
</div>
<p>No. 7 is the only medal known to the author referring to a military
prison in the Civil War. No specimen of it is found in the museum of
the American Numismatic Society. Nor do the catalogues, guide-books,
and other pamphlets published by the Libby Prison War Museum Association
in Chicago mention this medal that was probably issued by this
very association. There is nothing about it in the files of the Chicago
Historical Society. The Chicago newspapers of 1893 might have some
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
article or note. But as they are not indexed it would take a great deal
of time and labor to search through them.</p>
<p>The very heavy medal measures seventy-one millimetres in diameter.
It is made of type metal, coated with a bluish-black lacquer. The obverse
shows in its upper part the following legend: LIBBY PRISON;
and in the lower part: WAR MUSEUM/ CHICAGO 1893. The space
in the center is occupied by the picture of Libby Prison as it stood in its
original place in Richmond, Virginia. Four prisoners&rsquo; tents are visible
in the foreground. Of course, no barbed wire, and not even a fence are
indicated. Instead sentries can be seen in front of the main building
as well as of the tent-barracks, their number being six <i>in toto</i>. The picture
is that well known from contemporary drawings or etchings.</p>

<p>The reverse of the medal bears an extensive legend in eighteen lines.
These are surrounded by a circular panel, showing on top clasped hands,
at the bottom crossed sabres. The panel inscription reads: NO SECTIONALISM&mdash;1861&mdash;NO

The eighteen-line legend gives an historical account of Libby
Prison and its transformation into the Chicago War Museum:</p>

<p>The history of Libby Prison as sad as it is romantic is too well known
to be retold here even briefly. The New York Public Library has in its
Americana collection no less than 222 items on Civil War prisoners and
prisons. Many of them are devoted exclusively or partially to Libby
Prison. The selected bibliography appended to this article will guide
historically interested readers. With reference to the medal under consideration
it is surprising that the famous commander of the prison,
Major Thomas P. Turner, found no mention in its historical legend. He
&ldquo;was always a gentleman,&rdquo; as one of the former prisoners wrote in his
memoirs.</p>
<p>In view of the fact that the medal is dedicated to the Libby Prison
War Museum in Chicago, the history of the removal of the building from
Richmond may be of interest. The following quotation is an excerpt
from the pertinent introductory chapter in the now rare <i>Catalogue and
Program</i> of the Libby Prison War Museum, first published probably in
1889 and later reprinted in the early eighteen-nineties:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The removal of Libby Prison from Richmond, Va. to Chicago
was a project never before equaled in the history of building moving
and one that will not be surpassed for years to come. This
famous old structure as a Confederate prison is too well known to
need the repetition of its history, and it is enough to state that it
was the palace prison of the South, and during the late war it held
more than 40,000 Union officers and enlisted men as prisoners. The
project of removing Libby Prison to Chicago was thought of by a
well-known Chicago business man who interested a syndicate of his
business associates, and as a result they visited Richmond in the
latter part of 1888 and took a thorough look over the ground....
Mr. Louis M. Hallowell, a well-known and experienced Philadelphia
architect, was engaged to work on the spot. He made all of the
working plans for taking the structure apart, shipping it to the
cars and rebuilding it in Chicago. The work commenced in December,
1888, and as the building was taken apart each board, beam,
timber and block of stone was numbered and lettered in such a
manner that there was not the least trouble about placing these
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
parts correctly together again in rebuilding.... Sending to Chicago
required 132 twenty-ton cars ... the re-erection of Libby Prison ...
was completed early in September. The Museum was opened to
the public September 21, 1889.... It contains the most complete
and valuable collections of Confederate relics in existence.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The museum was situated on Wabash Avenue between 14th and 16th
Streets. The enterprise proved a failure, however. The Libby Prison
War Museum was torn down in 1899, according to information received
from the Chicago Historical Society. The Coliseum was erected on the
site. The prison wall on the Wabash Avenue is now incorporated in the
facade of the Coliseum, all other material used having been disposed of.</p>
<p>The officers of the Libby Prison War Museum Association whose names
appear on the medal, are identifiable from their advertisements on the
covers of the <i>Catalogue</i>. The President, C. J. Gunther, was a confectioner
who advertised his candies; the Vice President, L. Manasse, an
optician; and the secretary-treasurer was a member of the law firm,
Schuyler and Kremer, &ldquo;attorneys at law and proctors in Admiralty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One would expect to learn that the medal was struck on some occasion
connected with the Libby Prison War Museum, either on the completion
of its rebuilding in Chicago or on its opening. This was, however, not
the case. There is no other indication as to when the medal was executed
except the year 1893 appearing on its reverse. It proves that the medal
must have been struck in connection with the Columbian Exposition held
in that year in Chicago. This is all that could be explored of its history.</p>
<p>Finally a token should be mentioned that refers to Civil War prisons,
though indirectly only. It is representative of a whole group of similar
tokens. In 1864-1865 a special committee of the United States Sanitary
Commission published the gruesome results of an inquiry into the privations
and sufferings of United States officers and soldiers during their
war imprisonment. It aroused, of course, the public at that time. The
United States Sanitary Commission, established in 1861, to cooperate
with the army, arranged a series of great fairs, popularly termed
&ldquo;Sanitary Fairs,&rdquo; in order to raise funds for the relief of sickness,
the improvement of hospital sanitation, and the promotion of the health
conditions among the armed forces in general. The Commission distributed
during the war supplies to the value of fifteen million dollars,
and funds amounting to five million more were received into its treasury,
at least two-thirds of which were obtained from the numerous &ldquo;Sanitary
Fairs.&rdquo; The first was held at Chicago in 1863, and many other cities
followed.</p>
<p>Tokens of the kind of that pictured here as No. 8 were given to the
&ldquo;cheerful givers.&rdquo; The obverse of No. 8 shows Washington&rsquo;s head facing
the right, at each side four stars, the legend being: GEO. WASHINGTON /
PRESIDENT. The reverse has the following inscription in
nine lines, the first three and last one curved: GOD LOVETH A
CHEERFUL GIVER / GREAT FAIR / IN AID OF THE / U. S. /
SANITARY / COMMISSION / NANTUCKET / MASS. / AUGUST
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
1864. The size is twenty-four millimeters. Specimens were struck in
silver, copper, brass, nickel, and tin.</p>

<p>To be sure, the present essay represents but a very modest contribution
to the discipline of medallic history. If through the methodological
approach of a specific problem it would aid in stimulating further research
in this little cultivated field, the author would consider this a
highly gratifying reward.</p>
